In this "repo", you can utilize it to find out how much your pay is.

You should be able to see how much money you are making in a week/month/year's time. All you have to do is input your hourly rate and then the amount of hours you worked. Please note, it does not adjust the pay if you have more than 40 hours in there. I am still working on that.
